here is my app for work. im working on it to try to bring it online currently. 
the CCT and CLP folders are releases. only  2.2.5 is stable right now and its also local and relies on Stores.json this program has no real use for anyone outside of my company but its essentially a database for compiling and documenting issues. 
Feel free to take, use, copy, redistribute commercially, no credit needed unless you want to. if you do use something from this project if would be cool if you woulld message me on Instagram and let me know what youre using it for just so i know cuz its cool to know things. Chroma_Glow_Synths on instagram. 

thanks
